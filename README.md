# Coding Architecture II: FS25

Materials for the "Coding Architecture II", Spring Semester 2025.

> Coding Architecture I-II<br>
> is a **programming class for architects**<br>
> with particular focus on **demystifying technology**
> -both software and hardware-<br>
> **and exploring the programmability of our world**<br>
> through powerful methods of digital, computational, and algorithmic design.

In the spring semester, we dive into digital timber using the `compas_timber` library to design reciprocal frame structures and materialize them.

## Getting started

See [here](/getting-started/README.md) for details about software requirements and installation of the tools.

## Course information

The central platform for all course content is [Moodle](https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=24557).

## Roadmap

See [here](roadmap/README.md) for the **Roadmap: becoming a computational designer**,
that provides guidance during the learning process and helps you understand how much
you've progressed and what are the skills and concepts that you should master in order
to move forward.
